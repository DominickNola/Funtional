  // TODO #7: version 2 of *totientPhi*

  // TODO #8: write function *primeFactors* that takes an integer and returns a flat list with the prime factors of the given number in ascending order.

  // TODO (optional): returns the number of times a number a can be evenly divided by a number b


  // TODO #9: write function *primeFactorsMult* similar to *primeFactors* but with the prime factors and their multiplicity.

  // TODO #10: write function *primesRange* that takes a range of integers and returns a list of all prime numbers within that range.

  // TODO #11: Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers; example: 28 = 5 + 23; it is one of the most famous facts in number theory that has not been proved to be correct in the general case; it has been numerically confirmed up to very large numbers; write function *goldbach* that takes an integer and returns the two prime numbers that sum up to it.


  // TODO #12: write the function *golbachList* that takes a range of integers and returns a list of all even numbers and their Goldbach composition.
